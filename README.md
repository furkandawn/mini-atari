# mini-atari

A mini retro-style game console built with the STM32F030R8 microcontroller, SSD1306 0.96' OLED display, 2 dimensional analog joystick, an external button.

STM32 cubeIDE 1.18.0 used for this project.



ðŸ“Œ About this Project ->

I started this project as a personal challenge to:

    âž¤Get started with embedded systems
    âž¤Build something fun and visual
    âž¤Push my understanding of C, memory, and hardware



 It includes:

    âž¤Menu systems with joystick navigation
    âž¤Snake, Tetris, Pong game. (Currently working on other two.)
    âž¤Modular code design with future games planned
    âž¤Score and level system
    âž¤Leaderboard System stored in flash


What I Learned/am learning ->

       âž¤STM32 Hardware Programming: 
          â€¢GPIO, ADC (for joystick), delays, memory layout
       âž¤SSD1306 OLED Display: 
           â€¢I2C protocol, text rendering, drawing graphics
      âž¤C Programming for Embedded: 
           â€¢Memory management, modular header/source file structures
      âž¤Game Design: 
          â€¢State machines, logic design for games like Snake
      âž¤Code Structuring: 
          â€¢Enum usage, header guards, static vs extern, file separation
      âž¤Flash Memory: 
       â€¢SRAM vs Flash, data segment layout, flash writing constraints
