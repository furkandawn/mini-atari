# mini-atari

A mini retro-style game console built with the STM32F030R8 microcontroller, SSD1306 0.96' OLED display, 2 dimension analog joystick.
Includes: A menu system, 5 games, game state management, and a modular embedded codebase written in pure C.

STM32 cubeIDE 1.17.0 used for this project.



ðŸ“Œ About the Project ->

I started this project as a personal challenge to:

    âž¤Get started with embedded systems
    âž¤Build something fun and visual
    âž¤Push my understanding of C, memory, and hardware



This project is a game console built on the STM32F030R8T6 microcontroller. It includes:

    âž¤A menu system with joystick navigation
    âž¤A working Snake game (only 1 game for now)
    âž¤Modular code design with future games planned
    âž¤Score and level system
    âž¤Various types of menus


What I Learned/am learning ->

       âž¤STM32 Hardware Programming: 
          â€¢GPIO, ADC (for joystick), delays, memory layout
       âž¤SSD1306 OLED Display: 
           â€¢I2C protocol, text rendering, drawing graphics
      âž¤C Programming for Embedded: 
           â€¢Memory management, modular header/source file structures
      âž¤Game Design: 
          â€¢State machines, logic design for games like Snake
      âž¤Code Structuring: 
          â€¢Enum usage, header guards, static vs extern, file separation
      âž¤Flash Memory: 
       â€¢SRAM vs Flash, data segment layout, flash writing constraints


Plans for future:
    
      âž¤Create a leaderboard system which user will be able to save his score and name directly to the flash memory when he hits a high score in the current game.
      âž¤Add special icons for each game at startup.
      âž¤Add more games (tetris as 2nd).
